# Understanding Relevant Laws and Regulations

In this chapter, we will explore legal considerations for managing religious diversity in the workplace. Employers have a legal obligation to prevent discrimination and harassment on the basis of religion, and to provide reasonable accommodations for employees' religious practices and beliefs.

Understanding Relevant Laws and Regulations

The following laws and regulations are relevant to managing religious diversity in the workplace:

Accommodating Religious Practices and Beliefs

Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees' religious practices and beliefs, unless doing so would cause an undue hardship on the employer. Common accommodation requests include time off for religious observances, flexible scheduling, and dress code accommodations.

To accommodate religious practices and beliefs, employers should:

* Develop clear policies and procedures for handling complaints of discrimination and harassment
* Encourage employees to report any incidents of discrimination or harassment
* Investigate all complaints of discrimination or harassment promptly and thoroughly
* Take appropriate disciplinary action against employees who engage in discriminatory or harassing behavior
